# billig-textual-analysis
A Python implementation of the textual analysis done by Michael Billig in Banal Nationalism (1995).

## What is this for?
This is a repository for my final project in GEOG 515. The texts included are two sermons from a church in a small town in South Carolina. The data generated was used to supplement an analysis of Christian and American Nationalism in the content of these sermons.  

## Usage:
Simply edit `config.py` to set an arbitrary `input_file` and `output_file`. A trivial wrapper could be implemented to do multiple analyses at once. This was unnecessary for the scope of this project, so I have not done so myself.
